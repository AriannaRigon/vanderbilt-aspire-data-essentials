"( ) Death rates (cases per 100,000 population per year) are age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population [ https://seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/stdpop.19ages.html ] (19 age groups: <1, 1-4, 5-9, ... , 80-84, 85+). Rates calculated using SEER*Stat. Population counts for denominators are based on Census populations as modified [https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/] by NCI. The 1969-.MORT_POPS_YR."" US Population Data File [https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/] is used for mortality data. \n""",,,,,,,,,,
"(à) The Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) is based on the APCs calculated by Joinpoint. Due to data availability issues, the time period used in the calculation of the joinpoint regression model may differ for selected counties. \n",,,,,,,,,,

"Please note that the data comes from different sources. Due to different years ( /historicaltrend/differences.html ) of data availablility, most of the trends are AAPCs based on APCs but some are APCs calculated in SEER*Stat. ( https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/ ) Please refer to the source for each graph for additional information. ",,,,,,,,,,
"Interpret Rankings provides insight into interpreting cancer incidence statistics.  When the population size for a denominator is small, the rates may be unstable.  A rate is unstable when a small change in the numerator (e.g., only one or two additional cases) has a dramatic effect on the calculated rate.",,,,,,,,,,
